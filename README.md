# email-signature


Custom email signature I made for my boss, A State Farm agent, using HTML and inline CSS. Template idea came from an email signature website but I completely overhauled the code and customized it completely. I only started with a template because I was unaware custom email signatures had to be created using tables and not lists. This issue took me hours to discover but once I figured it out, it was smoothe sailing
